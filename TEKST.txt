We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones
Most people are never going to die
Because they are never going to be born
The potential people who could have been here in my place
But who will, in fact, never see the light of day
Outnumber the sand grains of Sahara
Certainly those unborn ghosts
Include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton
We know this
Because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA
So massively exceeds the set of actual people
In the teeth of those stupefying odds
It is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here
We, privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds
How dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state
From which the vast majority have never stirred?
